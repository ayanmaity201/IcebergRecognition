# IcebergRecognition
This repository contains my project work on kaggle dataset [Statoil/C-CORE Iceberg Classifier](https://www.kaggle.com/c/statoil-iceberg-classifier-challenge). This data is a satellite image dataset that contains images of either iceberg or ship . So, our job is to predict whether it is iceberg or ship from these satellite images.

I have used deep learning methods for this classification problem . I have build several deep NN models on this dataset.
